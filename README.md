<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Malaria, spread by the female Anopheles mosquito, is a highly fatal disease widespread
in many parts of the world, causing 0.4 million deaths globally. Vital gene expressions
form the basis in the detection of malaria infection levels. Quantification of malaria
parasite infected RBCs and classification of its life cycle stages are done at macroscopic
level by experts, for making informed decisions. Off late multiple computational ap-
proaches have been proposed to circumvent the problem of dimensionality leading to
accurate predicted results. In this work a dimensionality reduction technique based
on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied on P. falciparum single-cell transcriptomics to
arrive at an optimized subset of features from the larger dataset. Features are chosen
based on their class variants considering increased efficiency and accuracy, to sepa-
rately transform the selected elements into a lower dimension. For the classification of the life cycle of malaria parasite based on single cell transcriptome data, a three-
pronged approach employing the multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic
Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) techniques is used. Distribution of cells was
visualised and mapped using the R-based Seurat package. Further, we constructed pro-
tein interaction networks of the genes identified by the feature selection method and
elucidated the role of the proteins in progression of the parasite through itâ€™s life cycle.
Our approach presents a novel protocol to implement ML techniques on scRNA seq
datasets and subsequently harnessing the extracted information for biomarker/drug
target detection.
